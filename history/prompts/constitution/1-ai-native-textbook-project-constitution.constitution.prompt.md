## Prompt

Project: AI-Native Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Purpose:
Create a high-quality, academically rigorous textbook using Docusaurus and deploy it using GitHub Pages. All content will be developed through Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code CLI, supported by MCP servers (Context7 for Docusaurus documentation and GitHub for repository operations).

Core Principles:
- Academic accuracy supported by primary sources
- Clarity for undergraduate and graduate computer science and robotics students
- Reproducibility: all claims, models, and references must be verifiable
- Rigor: prioritizing peer-reviewed robotics, AI, and embodied-intelligence research

Key Standards:
- All factual claims must be traceable to credible sources
- Mandatory APA-style citation for all references
- At least 50% of the sources must be peer-reviewed research papers
- Zero-tolerance for plagiarism (content must pass automated plagiarism check)
- Writing must follow Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10–12 for clarity

Constraints:
- Total textbook length target: 5,000–7,000 words
- Minimum of 15 high-quality academic sources
- Output format: Docusaurus-ready Markdown pages
- Final compiled version exported as PDF with embedded citations
- All Docusaurus content and structure must follow documentation at:
  https://context7.com/websites/docusaurus_io

Content Requirements:
- Coverage of Physical AI, Embodied Intelligence, Humanoid Robotics fundamentals
- Hardware + software architecture explanations with diagrams
- Hands-on labs and exercises (simulation + physical robotics)
- Real-world applications and current research trends
- Safety, ethics, and alignment considerations in humanoid robotics

Success Criteria:
- Every claim is sourced and validated
- APA citations correctly formatted and embedded
- Passes all fact-checking and plagiarism detection
- Builds and runs cleanly in Docusaurus
- Deploys successfully to GitHub Pages through Claude Code MCP GitHub server
- Produces a polished, professional textbook suitable for academic use
