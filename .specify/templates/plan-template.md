# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Academic Rigor Compliance
- [ ] All technical decisions verified against authoritative sources
- [ ] Research methodology follows academic standards
- [ ] Claims about technology choices are fact-checked and cited

### Technical Excellence Compliance
- [ ] Code quality standards (Type hints/TypeScript strict mode) addressed
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80% planned for critical paths
- [ ] Error handling and logging architecture designed
- [ ] Security-first approach integrated (authentication, data privacy)
- [ ] Performance optimization considerations included
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) addressed

### User-Centered Design Compliance
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design approach planned
- [ ] Progressive enhancement strategy considered
- [ ] Graceful degradation for feature failures designed

### Technical Constraints Compliance
- [ ] Frontend technology stack: Docusaurus v3, React 18+, TypeScript
- [ ] Backend technology stack: FastAPI (Python 3.11+), async/await
- [ ] Database: Neon Serverless Postgres planned
- [ ] Vector DB: Qdrant Cloud Free Tier planned (1GB limit)
- [ ] LLM: OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs planned
- [ ] Authentication: Better Auth planned
- [ ] Free tier services only (no paid plans) - budget constraint met

### Performance Standards Compliance
- [ ] Page Load target: <3 seconds on 3G connection considered
- [ ] API Response target: <500ms for 95th percentile planned
- [ ] Chatbot Response target: <5 seconds for RAG queries planned

### Success Criteria Alignment
- [ ] Technical success criteria considered in design
- [ ] Functional success criteria mapped to implementation plan
- [ ] User Experience success criteria addressed

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
